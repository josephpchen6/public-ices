## Project Summary

Our goal is to utilize the large datasets from Prof. Fagen-Ulmschneider which contains UIUC coursework, GPA Info, and “Excellent” ranked professors to create a coursework planning tool. We also found another dataset which contains basic prerequisite requirements for each course. Students would be able to upload a list of their completed coursework, and then display classes which they are eligible to take, filtered by subject or by professor excellence.
